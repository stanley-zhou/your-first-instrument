"""your-first-instrument — a sense of time for a model that has none.

Why time? Ask your Claude "how long have we been talking?" WITHOUT this
connected. It can only guess: no clock lives in a context window. This
server is the smallest honest fix — and the pattern generalizes to any
instrument you can imagine. See docs/adr/ for every choice made here.
